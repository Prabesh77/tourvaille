With a combination of both white and red mountains, it is a sight to surprise.

It is remoted, sparsely inhabited, and the tea house there is currently under refinement. Although the services offered are fundamental, the hospitality of local people is undeniably phenomenal. Only experienced trekkers have toured Kanchenjunga Trek in Nepal, and this is due to its somewhat difficulty and separation. Enabled Kanchenjunga Base Camp Trekking to preserve its prestigious charm, beauty, and mystery."
