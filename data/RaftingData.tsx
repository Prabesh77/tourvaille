    desc: "Unlike the lower Seti, Upper Seti rafting lets you enjoy a quick adrenaline rush, taking you through continuous rapids for more than 40 minutes. What makes it so special is that it presents the same number of rapids as the Kali Gandaki, with the difference being that it presents them in just 40 minutes while Kali Gandaki takes three days! If you’re an adventure lover, you’re sure to fall in love with the landslide rapid, the most challenging rapid of Upper Seti. Be aware though that Upper Seti is most fun after monsoon season in mid September through October as the water levels are high.",
